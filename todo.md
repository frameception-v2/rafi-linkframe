Here's a focused 20-task checklist following the implementation sequence:

**Foundation Setup**
- [x] Create `/app/frame/page.tsx` with responsive CSS Grid layout and viewport units
- [x] Initialize Farcaster Frame SDK v2.1 with basic frame metadata
- [x] Create LinkData interface and Context API provider skeleton

**Data Layer**
- [x] Implement React Query hooks in `/lib/data.ts` with Zod validation
- [x] Add localStorage integration for pinned links persistence
- [x] Set up IndexedDB database for recent links caching
- [x] Create sessionStorage manager for view state tracking

**Rendering System**
- [x] Build LinkList component with conditional pinned/recent rendering
- [x] Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox hybrid layout in LinkList
- [x] Add touch swipe detection with velocity threshold
- [x] Create semantic HTML structure with ARIA labels

**Interactions**
- [ ] Develop unified touch/mouse event system in `/lib/input.ts`
- [ ] Implement long-press detection for context menus
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation handlers in ViewManager
- [ ] Create swipe progress indicators with CSS transforms

**Storage Integration**
- [ ] Wire React Query cache to localStorage sync
- [ ] Add IndexedDB cleanup scheduler for expired links
- [ ] Implement sessionStorage rehydration on mount

**Farcaster Integration**
- [ ] Set up Wagmi Ethereum config in `/lib/farcaster.ts`
- [ ] Add signed message validation with frame payload parsing
- [ ] Implement error recovery system for failed casts

**Final Assembly**
- [ ] Compose all providers in page.tsx root component
- [ ] Connect Farcaster wallet state to UI actions
- [ ] Run final accessibility audit with screen reader tests

Each task represents about 1-2 hours of focused work and produces testable output. The sequence maintains dependency order while allowing parallel work on isolated systems (e.g., data layer vs rendering). Complete foundation tasks first before moving to interaction layers.
